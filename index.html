      <p class="header">Dawn</p>
      <div class="bg bg1">
      <p  class="section" >Dawn is the time that marks the beginning of twilight before sunrise. It is recognized by the appearance of indirect sunlight being scattered in Earth's atmosphere, when the centre of the Sun's disc has reached 18° below the observer's horizon.[1] This morning twilight period will last until sunrise (when the Sun's upper limb breaks the horizon), when direct sunlight outshines the diffused light.</p>

  <p class="header">Late Morning</p>
       <div class="bg bg3">
<p class="section" >Late morning" generally refers to the latter part of the morning, typically between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM, or the time period leading up to noon. It's the time window when the morning is nearing its end, and depending on the context, could be interpreted as being close to lunchtime or before the afternoon. The exact time can be a bit flexible, but it generally implies a time closer to the middle of the morning rather than the very beginning. </p>

   <p class="header">Sunset</p>
             <div class="bg bg6">
<p  class="section">Sunset (or sundown) is the disappearance of the Sun at the end of the Sun path, below the horizon of the Earth (or any other astronomical object in the Solar System) due to its rotation. As viewed from everywhere on Earth, it is a phenomenon that happens approximately once every 24 hours, except in areas close to the poles. The equinox Sun sets due west at the moment of both the spring and autumn equinoxes. As viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, the Sun sets to the northwest (or not at all) in the spring and summer, and to the southwest in the autumn and winter; these seasons are reversed for the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
